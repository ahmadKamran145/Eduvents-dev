            <p>
              Eduvents is an online directory and marketplace for education-focused events. We provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>a platform for organisers to list events such as conferences, CPD, webinars, podcasts and festivals</li>
              <li>a searchable interface for educators and other users to find and click through to events hosted by third parties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We curate and manually review listings for quality and relevance, but we do not organise, operate or host the events themselves, and we are not a party to any contract between you and an organiser.
