            <p>
              Eduvents is a trading name of Doceo Consulting Ltd ("we", "us", "our"). We operate an online platform that lists education-focused events for educators and other professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doceo Consulting Ltd is registered in England and Wales (Company No. 12962009), registered office at 36 Rathmore Road, London SE7 7QW, United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are the data controller for personal data processed in connection with the Eduvents website.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any questions about this policy or how we handle your data, contact:<br />

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Scope of this policy</h2>
            <p>This policy explains how we collect, use and share personal data when you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>visit or use the Eduvents website</li>
              <li>submit an event listing as an organiser</li>
              <li>contact us by email or via any forms on the website</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It does not cover the websites or services of event organisers or any third-party sites we link to. Those organisations are separate controllers of your data.
            </p>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. The data we collect</h2>
            <p>Even without user logins, we collect and process the following categories of personal data:</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Website usage and technical data:</h3>
            <p>
              IP address, browser type and version, device identifiers, approximate location (country/region), pages visited, time and date of visits, referral sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              This may be collected via server logs and cookies/Google Analytics.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Organiser data (when submitting an event):</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Organiser name, organisation name (if provided), email address, and any other contact details you choose to include in the listing.</li>
              <li>Event content you provide, which may incidentally include personal data (e.g. speaker names).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Payment-related data:</h3>
            <p>
              We do not collect or store card numbers or bank details.
            </p>
            <p>
